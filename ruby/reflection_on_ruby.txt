Data Structures
1. Why are data structures useful in programming?
To help keep multiple groups of data organized and accessible. 

Arrays
2. Define "array" and describe the characteristics of an array.
List of items.
Use index to access items in arrays. They are ordered. They can be stored in a variable.

3. Give two original examples of data sets that an array might be well-suited for.
Pet's names. List of inventory. 

Hashes
4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
List of labeled data. Enclosed in curly braces, data is labeled,uses key and value.

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
1. Organizing a collection of books by author or genre
2. Organize the student council board 

Iteration
6. Why is iteration useful?
So you can shorten the amount of time it takes to perform the same thing(method) with each piece of your code. 

7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Taking inventory. 

Blocks
8. What is a block?
Portable code that makes up it's own mini-program. 

9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
The block parameter is where you name what the block is. Blocks get them from pipes.
