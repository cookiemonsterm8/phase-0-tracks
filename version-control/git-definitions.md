# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Verison Control is a program that allows you to keep versions of a file so you can see how itâ€™s changed over time. Why is it useful? It's useful because it allows you to track changes. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one? a branch is a commit in which you've worked on a change to the original product. You would use one so you could track the changes you've made over time while retaining the original program in case you have to scrap the change you've made. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point in the changing of a document. 
* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two documents are committed with the same change or different changes in the same line. You will have to tell git what to do in this case.
